The List

We have created a project using the Amazon Affialiate API, MaterializeCSS, MYSQL database, Heroku and the npm-rand-token in order to design a blog-like list.  Our list allows users to pick out items from the Amazon database and write a description or a review.  The list of items can be shared to friends and family as a reference to recommend a specific PC game build or even a set of supplements and gear for the gym.  Many YouTubers, gamers, and celebrities can use this list in order to promote social media like ad campaigns while earning money through commmission from Amazon Affialiate API (Amazon pays a commission for the items purchased through the list of items provided in our app and your own API key).

How-To-Use The LIST:

Step 1: Sign-up!

Step 2: Search for the item of your choice and briefly describe or review your selection.

Step 3: Add the item onto your personal list to share!

Step 4: Repeat until you have a list of items and you're done.

Step 5: Get paid when someone buys an item off your list.

Below, we have a preview of 'The List' in action:
